DNS Request: When you type “https://www.google.com” in your browser, the first step is a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your computer needs to translate the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address that servers can understand. This process involves querying DNS servers to obtain the correct IP address. DNS uses a distributed database system, which means the mapping of domain names to IP addresses is spread across many servers globally. Also, once a DNS lookup is performed, the result can be cached locally on your computer to speed up future requests to the same domain.

TCP/IP: Once the DNS resolution is complete, the browser initiates a connection using TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). TCP ensures reliable data delivery by establishing a connection-oriented session between your computer and the server, while IP handles the routing and addressing of data packets across the internet. TCP/IP is actually a suite of protocols and not just two separate ones. It forms the foundational communication language of the internet.

Firewall: Data packets must pass through a firewall, a security barrier designed to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. The firewall ensures that only authorized and safe data is allowed to reach your computer. Firewalls can be hardware or software-based. They use predefined rules to allow or block traffic and can be found in devices like routers or operating systems.

HTTPS/SSL: To secure the communication between your browser and the server, the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol is employed. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), encrypts the data transmitted, preventing eavesdropping or tampering by malicious entities. It’s worth noting that SSL has been largely deprecated in favor of its successor, TLS. These protocols not only encrypt data but also provide authentication, ensuring you’re communicating with the intended server.

Load-Balancer: In the case of large-scale websites like Google, load-balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This ensures optimal resource utilization, enhances performance, and prevents any single server from being overwhelmed with requests. Load balancers use various algorithms to distribute traffic, such as round-robin or least connection. They can also provide health checks on servers and direct traffic away from unhealthy ones.

Web Server: The web server receives the encrypted request and responds by serving the requested web page. It processes HTTP requests, handles static content, and may execute server-side scripts. Web servers can serve static content directly, but for dynamic content, they often communicate with an application server. Popular web servers include Apache and Nginx.

Application Server: For dynamic content or interactive elements, an application server comes into play. It processes business logic, retrieves data from databases, and generates content dynamically before sending it back to the web server. These servers run the logic of an application, often written in languages like Python, Ruby, or Java. They generate dynamic content by executing code and running queries on the database.

Database: When your request involves retrieving or storing data, the application server communicates with a database. This is where information such as search results, user preferences, or any other dynamic data is stored and retrieved. Databases can be SQL-based (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) or NoSQL-based (like MongoDB or Cassandra). They store and retrieve data as required by the application server.

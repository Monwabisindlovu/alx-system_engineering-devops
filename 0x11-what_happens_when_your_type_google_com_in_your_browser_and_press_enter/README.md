0x11 Project: Web Stack Exploration
Overview
Welcome to the 0x11 project! This initiative, spearheaded by Sylvain Kalache, aims to unravel the intricacies of the web stack. As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, this project provides a unique opportunity to showcase your understanding of what transpires when a user types "https://www.google.com" into their browser and hits Enter.
## Project Overview

This project is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of the web stack on top of the internet. We'll be focusing on the infrastructure side of things, exploring concepts like network protocols, servers, and security.

## What We'll Cover

We'll start by dissecting a DNS request, understanding how domain names are resolved to IP addresses. We'll then move on to TCP/IP, the backbone that powers internet communication.

Next, we'll discuss firewalls and their role in securing network communication. We'll also delve into HTTPS/SSL, understanding how they provide secure, encrypted communication over the internet.

We'll then explore the concept of load balancing and its importance in distributing network traffic. We'll also look at how web servers respond to requests by serving web pages.

Finally, we'll dive into application servers and databases, understanding how dynamic web content is generated and served.

## How to Contribute

This project is open for contributions! If you have insights or improvements to share, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Blog Post and Diagram

As part of this project, I've written a detailed blog post explaining the entire process. I've also created a diagram to visually represent the flow of a request. You can find these resources in the project repository.

## Let's Get Started!

I hope you're as excited as I am to dive into this project. Let's get started!
